           <p class="card-text1">Kat here, I'm the Software Developer currently working as a Learner Specialist at 2u/edX. I'm from South Africa, based in Centurion.

            I graduated from a bootcamp called WeThinkCode_, On a non-technical note, I also have my Diving License which doesn't get enough use!
            
            My tech stack is HTML, CSS and JavaScript. (I don't touch the back-end often, but in the processing of touching it as often as I can).
            
            I'm happiest when I'm creating, learning, exploring and thinking about how to make things better.
