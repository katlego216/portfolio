            <p class="card-text1">Kat here, I'm the Software Developer currently working as a Learner Specialist at
                2u/edX. I'm from South Africa, based in Centurion.

                I graduated from a bootcamp called WeThinkCode_, On a non-technical note, I also have my Diving License
                which doesn't get enough use!

                My tech stack is HTML, CSS and JavaScript. (I don't touch the back-end often, but in the processing of
                touching it as often as I can).

                I'm happiest when I'm creating, learning, exploring and thinking about how to make things better.
